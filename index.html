	<h3>Hi there, I'm Jen Reeve!</h3>
	<p>I'm a PhD student at CU Boulder in the Geological Sciences Department, and with no training in geology! 
		Instead I do microbiology and microbial evolution research in the context of Earth history in an attempt to understand
		how Earth and life co-evolved. <a href="/research">Read more about my research...</a></p>
