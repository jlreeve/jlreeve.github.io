	<h3>Fungal degradation of crude oil</h3>
	<p>This project was based on samples collected from beaches on the Gulf of Mexico. 
		The White Lab at Haverford regularly collected oil-soaked sand patties from the beaches and brought them back to lab for hydrocarbon analyses. 
		A few of these sand patties grew fungi while in storage which prompted the question: what exactly were the fungi doing? And were they successfully breaking down the oil? 
		My work on this project involved growing isolates of the fungi on plates inoculated with crude oil and taking samples for hydrocarbon analysis on a regular basis. 
		While I was working on the project we were able to tell that the fungi were in fact munching on the crude oil, but we couldn't get too precise because we hadn't figured out the best way to grow the fungi. 
		After I left the work continued and a year after I graduated from Haverford the project was published in Marine Pollution Bulletin.
